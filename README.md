# Push it

Installs the 80s classics [Push it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YleXlgHI1oM) and
[Push It To The Limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO2VIuDHzxM) as a Git commit hook in the
current repository. Oh, and cranks the volume to 10. Every second. Which can't be stopped.
Unless you push it.

# I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset>) if you can't get it
to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.

# Push it

There's always that one guy who forgets to push his commits before he goes
home for the day. Help him remember by playing an '80s classic on every commit. An
'80s classic that pins the volume to 10 and can't be stopped until it's pushed.

## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset>) if you can't get it
to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.
